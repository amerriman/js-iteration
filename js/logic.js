/*

Hints for the first problem:

  1. Define a function that:
    - is assigned to a variable named `sum`
    - has one parameter named `options`
    - returns the calculated sum of all of the values of all of the options passed in

NOTE: use a `for` loop to make this happen.

//1
var sum = function(options){
  //return calculated sum of all values of the options passed in
  //Variable that holds the sum, and one that counts
  var counter = 0;
  var calcSum = 0;
  //while there are prices in the list, keep adding them up
  while (counter < options.length){
    calcSum += options[i];
    counter++;
  }
  return calcSum;
}
console.log(sum(options))


//4
var average = function(options){
  var total = 0;
  var counter = 0;
  while(counter < options.length) {
    counter +=
  }
  return average;
}
